# How to Crack HASP Protected Programs Without the Dongle
 
HASP (Hardware Against Software Piracy) is a common protection scheme that uses a dongle (a hardware device) to encrypt and decrypt the program code. The dongle contains a secret key that is required to run the program. Without the dongle, the program will not work properly or at all.

However, some people may want to crack HASP protected programs without the dongle for various reasons. For example, they may have lost or damaged the dongle, or they may want to run the program on multiple machines without buying multiple dongles. In this article, we will explore some methods and tools that can help you crack HASP protected programs without the dongle.
 
## Method 1: Unpack the HASP Envelope
 
One of the most common ways to protect a program with HASP is to use the HASP Envelope tool. This tool wraps the original program executable with a layer of encryption and decryption code that communicates with the dongle. The encrypted program can only be decrypted and executed by the HASP Envelope code with the correct dongle.
 
To crack a program protected by HASP Envelope, you need to unpack the envelope and restore the original program executable. This can be done by using tools such as OllyDbg, ImpREC, and LordPE. You also need some knowledge of assembly language and debugging techniques. The basic steps are as follows:
 
1. Load the protected program in OllyDbg and set a breakpoint at the entry point.
2. Run the program until it reaches the breakpoint. You should see some code that checks for the presence of the dongle.
3. Trace over or skip the code that checks for the dongle and find the code that decrypts the program.
4. Dump the decrypted program from memory using ImpREC or LordPE.
5. Fix the import table and relocation table of the dumped program using ImpREC or LordPE.
6. Save the dumped program as a new executable file.
7. Run the new executable file without the dongle.

This method works for most programs protected by HASP Envelope, but it may not work for some programs that use more advanced protection techniques, such as anti-debugging, anti-dumping, or anti-patching.
 
## Method 2: Emulate the HASP Dongle
 
Another way to crack a program protected by HASP is to emulate the dongle and make the program think that it is connected to a valid dongle. This can be done by using tools such as HASP Emulator or BrainStudio HASP Emulator. You also need to have access to a valid dongle or a dump file of a valid dongle. The basic steps are as follows:

1. If you have a valid dongle, use a tool such as BrainStudio HaspDumper to dump its data to a file.
2. If you have a dump file of a valid dongle, use a tool such as Glasha DmpToReg to convert it to a registry file.
3. Import the registry file to your system registry using RegEdit.
4. Run a tool such as HASP Emulator or BrainStudio HASP Emulator and select the registry file as the source of emulation.
5. Run the protected program without the dongle.

This method works for some programs protected by HASP, but it may not work for some programs that use more complex communication protocols with the dongle or that check for other features of the dongle, such as serial number or memory contents.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have discussed two methods to crack HASP protected programs without the dongle: unpacking the HASP Envelope and emulating the HASP Dongle. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and they may not work for all programs. Therefore, you should always try to obtain a legal copy of the program and its dongle if possible. Cracking HASP protected programs without the dongle is not only illegal but also risky, as it may damage your system or expose you to malware.
